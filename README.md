Wikipedia Sort and Resort

## Sample Coding Exercise

Leveraging the Wikipedia API, weâ€™d like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. Please be sure to use Bootstrap as the framework of choice for building out the front end components AND be sure to make it responsive.
